## Hello there 👋

🙋‍♀️ `Pals Coding` was founded by three close friends who wish to develop their coding abilities and contribute to open source.

🌈 Our first goal is to develop a cross-platform language learning application.

👩‍💻 Although we are just getting started, we hope to expand our community over time.

🍿 Fun fact - We graduated from the same university in the same year!
